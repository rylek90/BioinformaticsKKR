# **.NET Bio Overview Application**
## **Sequence Manipulator**

The application is designed to process amino acids, DNA and RNA sequences.
Main goals were to perform translations and sequences alignments without implementing algorithms themselves, 
but make use of functions delivered by ready-made solution. We have developed an application that can be used to:
- import and export data in multiple formats and alphabets
- find local and global alignment of two sequences
- align sequences using various methods and parameters
- find edit distance

We use .NET Framework and .NET Bio library in order to achieve the task.
We use Modern UI template on the top of the view layer.
